## How It Works

### Our Approach: Why More Accurate Than Generic AI

**🎯 Condition-Specific Models**
- Separate AI models trained for each condition (diabetes, heart disease, etc.)
- Each model uses the most relevant features for that specific condition
- Avoids the "one-size-fits-all" problem of generic AI chatbots

**📊 Probability Calibration**
- Risk scores are calibrated to reflect real-world probabilities
- 70% risk score means 7 out of 10 people with your profile have the condition
- Confidence intervals show the uncertainty range

**🔍 Transparent Explanations**
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technology shows which factors drive your risk
- No "black box" - you see exactly why you got your score
- Feature contributions ranked by importance

**📋 Evidence-Based**
- Models trained on validated medical datasets
- Performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) published
- Regular validation against clinical outcomes

### The 3-Step Process

```

**💡 Tips:**
- Be accurate with measurements - BMI is a key risk factor
- Height/weight are used for BMI calculation if you don't know yours
- Ethnicity helps with population-specific risk adjustments

### Step 2: Vital Signs

**Blood Pressure:**
```
Systolic (top number): [e.g., 140]
Diastolic (bottom number): [e.g., 90]
```

**Heart Rate:**
```
Resting heart rate: [e.g., 72 beats per minute]
```

**💡 Tips:**
- Use recent measurements (within 3 months)
- If you don't know, you can skip - models will use population averages
- Home BP monitors are acceptable for this assessment

### Step 3: Symptoms & Medical History

**Current Symptoms (check all that apply):**
- [ ] Chest pain or discomfort
- [ ] Shortness of breath
- [ ] Unusual fatigue
- [ ] Frequent urination

✅ Fasting Glucose: 140 mg/dL (Confidence: 98%) 
⚠️  LDL Cholesterol: 130 mg/dL (Confidence: 67% - Please verify)
❌ TSH: Not detected - Enter manually if available
```

**💡 Tips:**
- Newer reports (< 6 months) are most valuable
- Multiple reports show trends
- Always review extracted values for accuracy

### Step 5: Run Assessment

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate are the risk predictions?**
A: Our models achieve 80-90% accuracy (AUC scores) depending on the condition. However, individual predictions can vary. Risk scores should be interpreted as probability estimates, not definitive diagnoses. Always confirm with healthcare providers.

**Q: Can I trust this more than my doctor?**  
A: No! MediBridge AI is designed to **supplement**, not replace, medical care. Think of it as preparation for your doctor visit - it helps you ask better questions and understand your health status, but medical decisions should always involve healthcare professionals.

**Q: Why do you need so much information?**
A: More complete information leads to more accurate predictions. However, you can skip sections - the models will use population averages for missing data, though this may reduce accuracy.

**Q: How often should I use this tool?**
A: Every 3-6 months or when you get new lab results. Your risk profile can change as you age, modify lifestyle, or develop new conditions.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which AI models do you use?**
A: We use ensemble models combining Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM, with probability calibration using isotonic regression. Each condition has its own specialized model rather than one general-purpose model.

**Q: What datasets were used for training?**
A: Models are trained on validated medical datasets including UCI Medical Repository, Kaggle medical competitions, and synthetic data augmentation to improve representation across demographics.

**Q: How do you prevent bias in predictions?**
A: We test models across different demographic groups, use fairness metrics during development, and provide confidence intervals to indicate uncertainty. However, bias can still exist - discuss results with your doctor.

**Q: What happens if the PDF extraction is wrong?**
A: You can manually review and correct all extracted lab values before analysis. The system shows confidence scores for each extraction to help you identify potential errors.

### Privacy Questions

**Q: Do you sell my health data?**
A: No, never. We don't even permanently store your data, so there's nothing to sell. Our business model is based on software licensing, not data monetization.

**Q: Can my employer/insurance see my results?**
A: Only if you choose to share them. There are no automatic reporting mechanisms. If you create a share link, anyone with that link can view the results, so share carefully.

**Q: What if I'm in a public place?**
A: Use the tool in private when possible. The interface doesn't display sensitive information prominently, but health data should be entered carefully in public settings.

**Q: Do you comply with GDPR/other privacy laws?**
A: Yes, our privacy-first architecture complies with major privacy regulations. Since we don't store data, there's minimal compliance risk.

### Medical Questions

**Q: What if my results show high risk but I feel fine?**
A: Many conditions (like diabetes and high blood pressure) can be "silent" in early stages. High-risk results suggest you should consult a healthcare provider, even without symptoms.

**Q: Can this detect cancer?**
A: No, our current models focus on metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Cancer screening requires different approaches and should be discussed with your doctor based on age, family history, and risk factors.

**Q: What if I have conflicting results from different assessments?**
A: Risk assessment tools can vary in their approaches and data sources. Use multiple tools as data points, but always defer to professional medical evaluation for important health decisions.

**Q: Is this suitable for managing existing conditions?**
A: MediBridge AI is designed for risk assessment and prevention, not disease management. If you already have a diagnosed condition, work with your healthcare team for monitoring and management.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The PDF extraction isn't working.**
A: Try these steps:
1. Ensure the file is a clear, high-quality scan
2. Check that text is not rotated or upside down
3. Try uploading as a JPG/PNG image instead
4. Enter values manually if automatic extraction fails

**Q: I'm getting unrealistic results.**
A: This can happen if:
- Incorrect units were used (mg/dL vs mmol/L)
- Extreme values were entered by mistake
- Lab values are from different time periods
- Missing key information affects model accuracy

**Q: The website is slow or not loading.**
A: MediBridge AI requires processing power for AI calculations. Ensure:
- Stable internet connection
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Try refreshing if processing seems stuck
